STOCK RECOMMENDATION APPLICATION

This application is a command-line app that prompts the users to input the stock
symbols of their choice. Afterwards, the program will send the following information:
latest stock price
latest data refresh date
latest close price
highest price over the past 100 days
lowest price over the past 100 days
stock recommendation

Instructions:

In order to properly run this app, please read the requirements for this app.
There are certain modules and packages that are needed to run this application.
Additionally, you need to download an API key from AlphaVantage to receive
information outputs.

After you do this, please run this application from the command prompt and
insert the stock symbols of your choice. If you enter a stock symbol that
doesn't exist, the app will shut down and ask you to start over again. If you receive
this, simply re-run the program and make sure all of your stock symbols are correct.

This app will also write csv files into your 'data' directory that incorporates
the historical stock data over the past 100 days.

Enjoy.
